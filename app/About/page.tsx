Hello! I'm an aspiring web developer and a passionate student who enjoys learning about technology and creating meaningful digital experiences.

My journey in web development started with my curiosity about how websites and applications are designed and developed. As I continue learning, I have gained experience in building websites, working with databases, and developing backend systems.

I am continuously improving my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, and database management. I also enjoy exploring new tools and technologies that help me become a better developer.

I believe that every project is an opportunity to learn something new, improve my creativity, and solve problems. My goal is to become a skilled web developer who can create useful, user-friendly, and visually appealing applications.
